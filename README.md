### What I Learned
This week I learned that computer agents (ai) specifically are expected to do more by operating autonomously, perceive their environment and persist over a long period of time, adapt to change and create and pursue goals. I also learned that a rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best possible outcome, or when faced with uncertainty to expect the best possible outcome. I think it's interesting how AI is developed and I am looking forward to learning more.

### Challenges
A challenge that I am facing this week is that my textbook is very technical and I feel that I will have to re-read it a few times in order to understand it. I will attempt to take it slow, but I am concerned about falling behind due to the technical nature of the topic and reading load. Just hoping to do my best, and hopefully not get stuck on the fine details!
